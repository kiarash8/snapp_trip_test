# SnappTrip Technical Assessment

I have been assigned to create an efficient code that can manage network requests. The code must be a React custom hook written in TypeScript and should use either Loadash, Axios, or Fetch libraries. The custom hook should allow making requests to the server, managing any errors, and loading each request. It should also avoid duplicate requests to minimize requests to the server. Additionally, the hook should be reusable and capable of refetching requests even if the request is repeated.
